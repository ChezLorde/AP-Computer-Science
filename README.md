Here are the completed programs from my AP Computer Science course in high school. Below is a guide to what each one does.

Unit 1

  Lesson 1.1
  
    - 1.1.1: Draws a piece of art that is four squares inlaid with circles of different colors.
    
    - 1.1.2: Makes up a "land" of tiles of specified type and color. (field, water, house, castle)
    
    - 1.1.3: Draws 27-story towers forever.
    
    - 1.1.4: Draws a spiral.
    
    - 1.1.5: Creates a robot that solves a maze using preprogrammed instructions.
    
    - 1.1.6: Draws a spider.
    
    - 1.1.7: Draws a spiral of turtles.
    
    - 1.1.8: Creates a traffic scene with collisions of turtles.
    
    - 1.1.9: Draws the inputted number of crystals on the screen.
    
  Lesson 1.2
  
    - 1.2.1/1.2.2: A game where you try to click the onscreen turtle as many times as possible in the time limit. Displays a saved leaderboard using the "leaderboard" module.

    - leaderboard: A custom module for displaying an onscreen leaderboard with Turtle.

    - 1.2.3: A game that places apples with letters on a tree and drops them when the correct letter key is pressed.

    - 1.2.4-maze-collisions-v1: My first attempt at creating collisions in Turtle. It saves each point of the maze in a list, and moves the player back if they hit one of them. (Very slow)

    - 1.2.4-maze-collisions-v2: My improved method for turtle collisions, where ranges of values are saved. This makes the program much faster and more reliable.

    - 1.2.5-Legend of the Dot Dots: A game where you must avoid waves of oncoming enemies by making them crash into each other.

  Create Task: A text-based adventure game where you must travel through rooms looking for items.
