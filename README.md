Here are the completed programs from my AP Computer Science course in high school. Below is a guide to what each one does.

Unit 1

  Lesson 1.1
  
    - 1.1.1: Draws a piece of art that is four squares inlaid with circles of different colors.
    
    - 1.1.2: Makes up a "land" of tiles of specified type and color. (field, water, house, castle)
    
    - 1.1.3: Draws 27-story towers forever.
    
    - 1.1.4: Draws a spiral.
    
    - 1.1.5: Creates a robot that solves a maze using preprogrammed instructions.
    
    - 1.1.6: Draws a spider.
    
    - 1.1.7: Draws a spiral of turtles.
    
    - 1.1.8: Creates a traffic scene with collisions of turtles.
    
    - 1.1.9: Draws the inputted number of crystals on the screen.
    
  Lesson 1.2
  
    - 1.2.1/1.2.2: A game where you try to click the onscreen turtle as many times as possible in the time limit. Displays a saved leaderboard using the "leaderboard" module.

    - leaderboard: A custom module for displaying an onscreen leaderboard with Turtle.

    - 1.2.3: A game that places apples with letters on a tree and drops them when the correct letter key is pressed.

    - 1.2.4-maze-collisions-v1: My first attempt at creating collisions in Turtle. It saves each point of the maze in a list, and moves the player back if they hit one of them. (Very slow)

    - 1.2.4-maze-collisions-v2: My improved method for turtle collisions, where ranges of values are saved. This makes the program much faster and more reliable.

    - 1.2.5-Legend of the Dot Dots: A game where you must avoid waves of oncoming enemies by making them crash into each other.

  Lesson 1.3
  
    - 1.3.1: A password generator. 
    
Unit 2

  Lesson 2.1

    - 2.1.4 Tkinter: A model login interface created using Tkinter; not quite operational.

  Lesson 2.3

    - 2.3.1 encode and decode: Creates an encrypted image that can be decoded.

Unit 3

  Lesson 3.2

    - 3.2.1 Temp Analysis: Analyzes and plots the data from 3.2.1_temperature_data using pandas and matplotlib.

    - 3.2.1 CO2 Analysis: Analyzes and plots the data from 3.2.1_co2_data using pandas and matplotlib.
    
    - 3.2.2 Analysis: Analyzes electrical access data from 3.2.2_elec_access_data and plots it.

    - 3.2.3 Traveller Problem: Brute-force solves the "traveller problem" between five cities.

    - 3.2.3 Binary and Linear Search: Compares binary and linear search in finding a number in a given range.
  
  Create Task: A text-based adventure game where you must travel through rooms looking for items.
